# Crypto-Nuke
is a bitcoin monitoring program that actively monitors the price of bitcoin (usd). The idea being that whenever the price of bitcoin depleats, a deafening sound is played.

For fun I also added the fnaf cheer sound effect whenever the price increases.

The first release can be found here: [Release v0.0.0](https://github.com/chi-qui/crypto-nuke/releases/tag/alpha)

## Warning
I didn't do much research on *sound* and how to adjust it so that it doesn't destroy your ears, so make sure to ***NOT*** launch this at full volume and blow your ears out. Might make a sound adjuster in a later version but for now be cautious.
